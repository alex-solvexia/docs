title: Set Up Mutli-Factor Authentication
description: "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) helps to keep your data secure by making it difficult for somebody else to sign in as you. After you enter your password, as usual, you'll be asked to enter a 6-digit passcode. You can get the passcode from a text message (SMS) or an authentication app installed on your mobile device."

**Important:** Your SolveXia Client Administrator will need to [enable MFA for your Organisation](https://help.solvexia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413582569871).

### **To set up multi-factor authentication:**

1.  Log into SolveXia with your username and password 
2.  Enter your mobile number and click "**Get code via mobile**" to receive a verification code by SMS

5\. Once the code is verified you will see the following screen. As the instructions explain, download a two-factor authentication app on your mobile device (such [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447), [Authy](https://www.authy.com/), [Symantec VIP](https://m.vip.symantec.com/), and [Duo Mobile](https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile)). Next, open the app and scan the QR code seen on the screen. This will produce a 6-digit verification code which you will enter and then click **'Verify code and activate'**
